/*
C++ is not pure OOP - we can code in c++ as one can code in C
It is not a requirement to write everything in OOP
 
C++ started being developed in 1979, first released in 1983

Is a statically typed language, free form(no form of writing code, spaces don't really matter)

It has faster execution - it has no overheads
